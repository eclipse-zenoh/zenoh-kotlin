/**
 * # Address space
 *
 * Zenoh's address space is designed around keys which serve as the names of resources.
 *
 * Keys are slash-separated lists of non-empty UTF8 strings. They may not contain the following characters: `$*#?`.
 *
 * Zenoh's operations are executed on key expressions, a small language that allows the definition
 * of sets of keys via the use of wildcards:
 *
 *  - `*` is the single-chunk wildcard, and will match any chunk: `a/*/c` will match `a/b/c`, `a/hello/c`, etc...
 *  - `**` is the 0 or more chunks wildcard: `a/**/c` matches `a/c`, `a/b/c`, `a/b/hello/c`, etc...
 *  - `$*` is the sub-chunk wildcard, it will match any amount of non-/ characters: `a/b$*` matches `a/b`, `a/because`, `a/blue`... but not `a/c` nor `a/blue/c`
 *
 * To allow for better performance and gain the property that two key expressions define the same
 * set if and only if they are the same string, the rules of canon form are mandatory for a key
 * expression to be propagated by a Zenoh network:
 *
 *  - `**/**` may not exist, as it could always be replaced by the shorter `**`,
 *  - `** /*` may not exist, and must be written as its equivalent `*/**` instead,
 *  - `$*` may not exist alone in a chunk, as it must be written `*` instead.
 *
 * The `KeyExpr.autocanonize` constructor exists to correct eventual infringements of the canonization rules.
 *
 * A KeyExpr is a string that has been validated to be a valid Key Expression.
 *
 * # Memory
 *
 * Valid KeyExpr instances have associated an underlying native key expression, therefore we must be careful to properly
 * call [close] before the KeyExpr loses any of its references and becomes a phantom reference. As a precautionary measure,
 * this class overrides the [finalize] method which invokes [close] when the garbage collector attempts to remove the
 * instance. However, we should not fully rely on the [finalize] method, as per to the JVM specification we don't know
 * when the GC is going to be triggered, and even worse there is no guarantee it will be called at all.
 * Alternatively, we can use the key expression using a try with resources statement (`use` in Kotlin), since it will
 * automatically invoke the [close] function after using it.
 *
 * @param jniKeyExpr A [JNIKeyExpr] instance which delegates all the operations associated to this [KeyExpr] (intersects,
 * includes, etc.) which are done natively. It keeps track of the underlying key expression instance. Once it is freed,
 * the [KeyExpr] instance is considered to not be valid anymore.
