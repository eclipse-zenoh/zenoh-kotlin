/**
 * Class to represent a Zenoh Reply to a [Get] operation and to a remote [Query].
 *
 * A reply can be either successful ([Success]) or an error ([Error]), both having different information. For instance,
 * the successful reply will contain a [Sample] while the error reply will only contain a [Value] with the error information.
 *
 * Replies can either be automatically created when receiving a remote reply after performing a [Get] (in which case the
 * [replierId] shows the id of the replier) or created through the builders while answering to a remote [Query] (in that
 * case the replier ID is automatically added by Zenoh).
 *
 * Generating a reply only makes sense within the context of a [Query], therefore builders below are meant to only
 * be accessible from [Query.reply].
 *
 * Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * session.declareQueryable(keyExpr).with { query ->
 *     query.reply(keyExpr)
 *          .success(Value("Hello"))
 *          .withTimeStamp(TimeStamp(Date.from(Instant.now())))
 *          .res()
 *     }.res()
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * **IMPORTANT: Error replies are not yet fully supported by Zenoh, but the code for the error replies below has been
 * added for the sake of future compatibility.**
 *
 * @property replierId: unique ID identifying the replier.
