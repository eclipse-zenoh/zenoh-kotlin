 * ```kotlin
 * Session.open().onSuccess { session ->
 *         session.use {
 *             "demo/kotlin/example".intoKeyExpr().onSuccess { keyExpr ->
 *             session.delete(keyExpr)

 * A delete operation is a special case of a Put operation, it is analogous to perform a Put with an empty value and
 * specifying the sample kind to be `DELETE`.
