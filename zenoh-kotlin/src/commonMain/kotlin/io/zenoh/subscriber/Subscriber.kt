/**
 * # Subscriber
 *
 * A subscriber that allows listening to updates on a key expression and reacting to changes.
 *
 * Simple example using a callback to handle the received samples:
 * ```kotlin
 * val session = Session.open(Config.default()).getOrThrow()
 * val keyexpr = "a/b/c".intoKeyExpr().getOrThrow()
 * session.declareSubscriber(keyexpr, callback = { sample ->
 *     println(">> [Subscriber] Received $sample")
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Lifespan
 *
 * Internally, the [Session] from which the [Subscriber] was declared keeps a reference to it, therefore keeping it alive
 * until the session is closed. For the cases where we want to stop the subscriber earlier, it's necessary
 * to keep a reference to it in order to undeclare it later.
 *
 * @param R Receiver type of the [Handler] implementation.
 * @property keyExpr The [KeyExpr] to which the subscriber is associated.
 * @property receiver Optional [R] that is provided when specifying a [Handler] for the subscriber.
 * @property jniSubscriber Delegate object in charge of communicating with the underlying native code.
 * @see Session.declareSubscriber
